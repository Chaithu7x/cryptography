# Cryptographic Hub
The "Cryptographic Hub" is a simple web application designed to showcase and allow experimentation with different cryptographic techniques. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input text and perform encryption, decryption, and hashing operations using various cryptographic algorithms. The algorithms used are...

--> Advanced Encryption System (AES)

--> Caesar Cipher

--> Secure Hash Algorithm-3 (SHA-3)

### Key Feature: <br>
The speciality of this project lies in its ability to provide different ciphertext outputs for the same input text during the encryption process, enhancing data security and uniqueness.
